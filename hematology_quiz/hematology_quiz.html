Nucleated red blood cells (and unlysed RBCs) will lead to a falsely high WBC count, and are typically counted by the instrument as lymphocytes. For this reason, an instrument flag is generated if nucleated RBCs are detected. Traditionally, this requires smear review with a manual nRBC count and WBC differential, as well as correction (based on a manual calculation) of the WBC count if nRBCs are present. Automated hematology instruments that have the ability to quantify nucleated RBCs (such as the Sysmex XE and XN series) will also automatically correct the WBC count, percent lymphocytes and absolute lymphocyte count for this interference if present.\nThe remaining options should read as follows:<\u002fp>\n\n<p>A.

Platelet clumping or giant platelets: spurious decrease in platelet count and increase in WBC count. (If relatively few clumps are present, smear review can allow for a rough estimation of the platelet count using the following rule: under 1000x [oil] magnification, take the average count of any particle and multiply by a factor of 10‐15 to obtain a rough estimation of the count as measured in thousands/uL. If a more accurate platelet count is needed, one can often be obtained for patients with an EDTA‐ dependent platelet agglutinin by collecting the blood in citrate anticoagulant and multiplying the results by the dilution effect from the liquid anticoagulant, or by using a heparinized blood sample, in which case there is no need to correct for dilution. The Sysmex instrument used at MGH is validated for platelet measurements only from EDTA or sodium citrate [blue top] samples, so in cases where an accurate platelet count is needed, we request that they submit a blue top tube.)<\u002fp>\n\n<p>D.
